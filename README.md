# RUIN Game Engine

RUIN is my attempt at building a game engine from scratch and is in early development.

## Description

 This project is about rediscovering the computer graphics rendering techniques of old, using nothing but a pixel buffer. Eventually, this may develop into an engine for supporting a 3D dungeon crawling RPG.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Rust.

### Installing

* Clone the repo.

### Executing program

To build and run natively enter:
```
cargo run --release
```

To build and serve a WASM target locally enter:
```
cargo run-wasm --bin ruin_engine
```
